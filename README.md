This project was made using Python and is incomplete. I will be applying AI(Tensor Flow) to it in the future.

This was project was made for my son. When I put him in the room to sleep and I'm working on the computer with my headphones on, I can't hear him when he wakes up or starts crying. This project captures the sound in the room and sends me an email when the baby starts crying.

However, I need to apply tensorflow to for the program to differentiate between his crying and any other sound. I've collected a few samples of him crying but I haven't applied the tensorflow code.

I also need to add more security and change the email and password method that I'm currenlty using.

The libraries used in this are Sounddevice, numpy, and smtplib
